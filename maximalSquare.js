// Maximal Square

/*
    Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, 
    find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

    Example:

    Input: 

    1 0 1 0 0
    1 0 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1
    1 0 0 1 0

    Output: 4

*/

/*
    I - matrix (array of arrays) containing zeroes and ones
    O - the largest square of 1's area; 1's that are adjacent to each other
    C - time complexity; BFS recursions (linear x O log n)
    E - matrix that doesn't contain any 1's, only contains 0's
